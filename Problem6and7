PROBLEM 6 ANSWER

a. Minimum cardinality = 0 because a customer may exist without yet doing business in any region.
b. ITEM attributes: ItemID, ItemName, UnitPrice, QuantityOnHand, ReorderLevel, Description.
c. MATERIAL attributes: MaterialID, MaterialName, UnitOfMeasure, UnitCost, QuantityOnHand, ReorderPoint.


PROBLEM 7 ANSWER

No, I would not create a supertype/subtype relationship for this problem.

Because

All four vehicle classes (compact, midsize, full-size, sport utility) share the same attributes: VehicleID, Make, Model, Year, and Color.

None of the vehicle classes has attributes that are unique to that class.

None of the vehicle classes has unique relationships with other entity types (they all participate in the same Rents relationship with CUSTOMER).

Because there are no distinct attributes or relationships to justify specialization, a simple VEHICLE entity with a single attribute Category (values: Compact, Midsize, FullSize, SUV) is the most efficient design.
